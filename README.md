# Urban-Octo-Telegram-Module-1-Project

## Description

This Module 1 Project focuses on simplifying a CSS/HTML code given. Simplifcation methods such as grouping, adding/labeling a new section for CSS Codes, and manual updates were made in order to ensure that the CSS/HTML code given is not only simplified, but done in a correct manner where visuals and functions of the original website is coherent regardless of the code changes made throughout.

## User Story (Customer needs)

AS A marketing agency,
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards,
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards,

WHEN I view the source code,
THEN I find semantic HTML elements.

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements,
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

WHEN I view the image elements,
THEN I find accessible alt attributes.

WHEN I view the heading attributes,
THEN they fall in sequential order.

WHEN I view the title element,
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title.
